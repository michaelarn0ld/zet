# zet
----
This branch of Zet can be used if you want to maintain notes only locally. The
functionality of `-p` and some of the other features (AWS persistance) have
been removed here.

This has been inspired and influenced by [Rob Muhlestein](https://youtube.com/rwxrob).

Zet is a command line tool for creating and maintaining a personal Zettelkasten
(if you want to learn more about Zettelkasten, check mine out
[here](https://gitlab.com/michaelarn0ld/zettelkasten-public)). Please note that
this tool only works with Bash >= 4.0.

### GETTING STARTED
Before using this tool, there are a few prerequisites:
* Download ```zet``` from this repo to your machine and make sure that it is in
a place accessible by your ```$PATH``` environment variable
* In ~/.bashrc set the ```$EDITOR``` environment variable to your editor of choice
* Create a local directory where your Zettelkasten will live; make it a Git repo
and add a remote origin to your favorite Git repository hosting service.
* In this local zettelkasten directory, create a registry file ```REGISTRY.md```
* It's also a good idea to create a ```README.md``` file to describe your
objectives for the Zettelkasten
* Determine the location of bash by running: ```which bash```

### CONFIGURATION
Now that all the prerequisites have been met, you can configure ```zet``` so
it runs on your machine. Open ```zet``` in a text editor to make changes:
* Change the interpreter on ```zet``` to the output of ```which bash```
* Change ```PUBLIC``` to your local Zettelkasten directory
* If you want to have a private Zettelkasten, you may do the same thing for
```PRIVATE```. If you do not make a private Zettelkasten, please change this
line accordingly (note that you will not be able to use the ```-p``` or
```--private``` options).
